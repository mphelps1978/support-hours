Today we are going to be covering everything in Single Page Applications

### The Project - We will be creating a Ficticious Reservation System for an Airline

Steps:

[ ] - Create Routes and Links to the various pages

[ ] - Create a Form that the user can fill out with their name, origin, and destination, as well as any "extras" (child discount, senior discount, etc..)

[ ] - Create Validations for those forms to make sure it is being filled out correctly

[ ] - Send those results to reqres.in

[ ] - Take the response from requres.in and display a "Confirmation Page" with the information

[ ] - Test our form using cypress.io

[ ] - (Time permitting)  **Bonus** - Style our application, and learn a "styling library" called material UI
