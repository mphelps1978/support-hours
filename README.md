Good Morning!!

Today we're going to be building an application from scratch using The Movie DataBase

We will focus on three primary principals:
1. useState
2. useEffect
3. styled components.

There is no need to fork this repository, as we will be working together in VSCode's Live Share.

Tasks:
[] Set up API Call
[] Set Data to State
[] Display Data in both Grid and Details components
[] Style the page
